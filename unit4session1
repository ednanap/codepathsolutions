Problem 1: Prime Number
U - Understand

What is the smallest prime number, and why?
What is the approach for checking if a number is divisible by another?

P - Plan

Check if the number is less than or equal to 1, return False.
Loop through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by any number in that range, return False.
If the loop completes without finding a divisor, return True.

Pseudocode:

If n <= 1, return False.
Loop i from 2 to sqrt(n) + 1:
If n % i == 0, return False.
Return True.

I - Implement

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
